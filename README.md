# About the Project

The project was the final capstone as part of the Data Science Specialization provided by John Hopkins University on Coursera. It is based on the data provided by "Swift Key" in an attempt to improve the next word prediction.

In our daily lives, we all have been using some sort of predictions may it be during text messaging, watsapp or surfing on the internet, we all get recommendations for prospective next word. So, designing an optimum method to be able to predict the next word is vital in 2 terms i.e. accuracy of the word without compromising the speed. To achieve this, a model was designed by using a corpus comprising News and Twitter feeds.

The project has been completed using R on Rstudio with the final app deployed on ShinyApp with the link https://mohib9.shinyapps.io/The_Predictor/ .
